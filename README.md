NFC Chip Detector
The NFC Chip Detector is a mobile application designed to monitor the connection to an NFC chip. When the phone is disconnected from the NFC chip, the app sends an email containing the device's location and pictures taken from both cameras.

Requirements
A device with Android operating system
NFC functionality on the device
Camera(s) on the device
Location services enabled
Internet connection
Installation
Install the NFC Chip Detector application from the app store.
Ensure that your device has NFC functionality and that it is enabled.
Grant the necessary permissions for location, camera, and NFC access when prompted.
Usage
Launch the NFC Chip Detector app.
The app will display a message instructing you to place the phone near the NFC chip.
Place the phone near the NFC chip. The app will detect the chip and start monitoring the connection.
When the phone is disconnected from the NFC chip, the app will capture images using both cameras, fetch the device's location, and send an email with the location and pictures to the specified email address.
Troubleshooting
If the app fails to detect the NFC chip, ensure that your device has NFC functionality, and it is enabled in the settings.
If the app fails to send an email, check the internet connection and ensure that the email credentials and SMTP server configuration are correct.
If the app does not capture images or fetch location information, check if the necessary permissions have been granted.
Notes
The app runs in the background and keeps monitoring the NFC chip connection even when the device is locked. However, this may increase battery consumption.
The email sent by the app contains an email subject indicating the date and time the NFC chip was disconnected, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), and the pictures taken by both cameras.
The app does not store the captured images or location information on the device after sending the email.
